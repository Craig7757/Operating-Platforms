# Operating-Platforms
This program required cross-platform connection, a hosted server, and dynamic back-end support. While developing this documentation it was easy to find which operating systems were going to be preferable for development. In hindsight I would have payed more attention to the server-side costs associated with hosting and maintaining a server. It is possible to rent a third-party server hosting system. Transforming a user's need into functioning code takes time to develop a solution to that specific need, the user's needs drive the development process. The software designed for the user's needs should be implemented through the use of efficient code, which has a minimal impact on system performance.
